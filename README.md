## 3 segements are extracted fitting the data well

3 segements are made on basis age, like, visiting frequency

Segment 1 - Age group is between 15-35, 
            liking rate is 2.37, 
            Visiting frequency is one a month (average)
            
Segment 2 - Age group is between 36-54, 
            liking rate is 1.65, 
            Visiting frequency is one in 2 months (average)
            
Segment 3 - Age group is between 55-70, 
            liking rate is 1.33, 
            Visiting frequency is one in 3 months (average)
            


## Targeting segments


##### Target segment - 1st group
Here count of consumers is parallel with visiting frequency and likeing rate.
This group of consumers include largely students and working people. They are liking the food items with good visiting frequency. 
To increase this we need to make prices affordable for which various offers can be made available ( Games, one on one free, student offer etc.)

##### Target segment - 2nd group
Here count of consumers is parallel with visiting frequency and likeing rate.
To increase the sales, for this group service can be made more fast and more conveinient( as conveiniency dicreases with age) as these consumers are working proffesional so service should match their busy work schedule.

##### Target segment - 3rd group.
Here count of consumers is much but in comparison visiting frequency is lower so the likeing rate is also low.
As seen in age vs yummmy and other graphs, this group is not much liking the food items they are feeling it as more oily and spicy hence also thie liking rate and visiting frequency is less.
For this segment we need to make changes in product as they feel it more spicy and not much tasty.
